1. Explain the connection procedure followed in client server communication: 

Answer:

i) Server Initialization: The server initializes itself by creating a socket using the socket() system call.

ii) Binding: The server binds the socket to a specific address and port using the bind() system call.

iii) Listening: The server listens for incoming connections by calling the listen() system call.

iv) Client Initialization: The client initializes itself by creating a socket using the socket() system call.

v) Connection Establishment: The client connects to the server using the connect() system call, specifying the server's address and port.

vi) Accepting Connection (Optional): In some cases, if the server uses TCP, it accepts the incoming connection using the accept() system call, which creates a new socket for communication with the client.

vii) Data Transfer: Both client and server can now send and receive data through their respective sockets using the send() and recv() system calls for TCP, or sendto() and recvfrom() for UDP.

viii) Connection Termination (Optional): In TCP, the connection is terminated explicitly by either the client or the server using the close() system call. In UDP, since it's connectionless, no explicit termination is needed.
