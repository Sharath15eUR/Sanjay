Difference between process and threads:

Processes:

1. Processes provide strong isolation with independent memory spaces and resource allocation.
2. Creating a new process incurs significant overhead due to memory duplication and resource setup.
3. Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms are used for communication between processes.

Threads:

1. Threads share the same memory space and resources within a process.
2. Creating a new thread is lightweight compared to creating a new process.
3. Threads enable concurrency and parallelism within a single process.
