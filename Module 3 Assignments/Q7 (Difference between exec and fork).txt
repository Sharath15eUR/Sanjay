Difference between exec and fork:

exec():
1. replace the current process's memory space with a new program
2. the called process terminates and only the newly formed process exists.
3. the address space and variables of the parent process are substituted by the child process.

fork():
1. creates a new process which is a replica of called process
2. both, the parent and the child process exist during runtime.
3. address space and variables are copied to the child process.
